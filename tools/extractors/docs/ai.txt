- Vanilla AI:
  - When idle move to a random LOS block not occupied by an allied unit, using the priority system
  - Randomly decide to retreat the level when morale is low
  - Decide which weapon to use, when to use grenades, when to go in melee, when not to use AOE attacks so that friends aren't hurt

- Custom Made AI:
  - Teleporter assasins (when enemy spotted and no friendly adjacent to it, teleport behind it and switch to auto fire)
  - Suicide bombers (when enemy close and more than 2 explosives in inventory, prime everything, start running, move towards enemy, when adjacent drop all exposives, switch to auto fire)

  - Smoke usage (if taking crit damage or more than 33% health damage, prime and drop a smoke then move to an ally that is far away from closest enemy but close to us) (find closest enemy, for every ally calculate it's distance to that enemy minus it's distance to us, pick one with largest value)

Turret AI? 
  Turrets just get 360 vision and aggressive AI, that's enough
